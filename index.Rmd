## Abstract

The study I am working on is education. So far I have dowloaded data on educational achievement over time that give data on how much education people have achieved by county in the United States.  There are 4 categories of educational achievement: less than a high school diploma, high school diploma only, some college, and bachelor degree or higher. The data has been cleaned and some early visualizations have been created to help understand the data.

### 1. Discovery and Data Preparation

The first section of the project covers the data importation and cleaning, analysis, and visualizations to help me understand the data.
